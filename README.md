Project inspiration/reference: https://github.com/Haus226/tsp-problem


This project explores different metaheuristic algorithms, specifically Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and their integration with 2-opt local search to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It includes animated visualizations and result logging for comparative analysis.

Key Features:
- Implements ACO and GA for TSP
- Integrates 2-opt for local optimization
- Visualizes algorithm progress using matplotlib animation
- Logging results for analysis (convergence in terms of iteration, error rate in terms of path length)
